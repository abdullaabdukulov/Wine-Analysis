# Welcome to My Wine Analysis


## Task

Generally, I'm a junior data scientist, and I got a project from a company that specialized to produce wine. At the beginning I collected dataset for the project and cleaned as well. Then I explorated the cleaned data and analyzed. And also I predict prices by using machine learning models.


## Description

Firstly by scraping <a href="https://www.wine.com/">wine.com</a>, I got over 10 regions datasets by 'Name', 'Country', 'Varietal', 'Wine type', 'Rating', 'NumberOfRatings', 'Year', 'Price'. Then I cleaned to make them ready for analytics. In order to be more informed about the datasets I visualized them. After these stages It was a turn for Machine Learning. In order to condense the dataset I correlated the data I got only neccessary columns. And 
by LabelEncoder model from scikit learn library I encoded string typed columns then I predict price.


## Installation
